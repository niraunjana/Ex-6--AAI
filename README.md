<H1 ALIGN =CENTER>Implementation of Semantic ANalysis</H1>
<H3>Aim: to perform Parts of speech identification and Synonym using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. </H3> 
 <BR>
<h3>Algorithm:</h3>
Step 1: Import the nltk library.<br>
Step 2: Download the 'punkt', 'wordnet', and 'averaged_perceptron_tagger' resources.<br>
Step 3:Accept user input for the text.<br>
Step 4:Tokenize the input text into words using the word_tokenize function.<br>
Step 5:Iterate through each word in the tokenized text.<br>
•	Perform part-of-speech tagging on the tokenized words using nltk.pos_tag.<br>
•	Print each word along with its corresponding part-of-speech tag.<br>
•	For each verb , iterate through its synsets (sets of synonyms) using wordnet.synsets(word).<br>
•	Extract synonyms and antonyms using lemma.name() and lemma.antonyms()[0].name() respectively.<br>
•	Print the unique sets of synonyms and antonyms.
